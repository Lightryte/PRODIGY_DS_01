Data Visualization Task - Distribution Analysis

Overview

This project was completed as part of my data science internship. The goal was to create visualizations to analyze the distribution of a variable in a dataset. Specifically, I used Python to visualize the distribution of categorical and continuous variables using a bar chart and a histogram. This task aimed to provide insights into the data's structure and make trends and patterns easier to understand.

Objectives

1. Understand the Data: Get familiar with the dataset, identify variables, and understand their types (categorical or continuous).


2. Data Visualization: Create visualizations (bar charts and histograms) to analyze the distribution of selected variables.


3. Tool Proficiency: Develop skills in using popular Python libraries for data visualization.



Steps and Methodology

1. Load the Dataset

Description: The dataset was loaded using the pandas library in Python.

Code Snippet:

import pandas as pd

# Load your dataset 
df = pd.read_csv('dataset.csv')


2. Inspect and Understand the Data

Description: Performed a quick inspection to understand the structure, types of data, and any potential data quality issues.

Code Snippet:

# View the first few rows
df.head()

# Check for data types and missing values
df.info()


3. Select Variables for Visualization

Description: Chose a categorical variable (e.g., gender) and a continuous variable (e.g., age) to analyze their distributions.


4. Create a Bar Chart for the Categorical Variable

Description: Used a bar chart to show the distribution of a categorical variable (like gender). This helped visualize the count of each category.

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.countplot(x='gender', data=df, palette='Set2')
plt.title('Distribution of Gender')
plt.xlabel('Gender')
plt.ylabel('Count')
plt.show()


5. Create a Histogram for the Continuous Variable

Description: Created a histogram to display the distribution of a continuous variable (like age), showing how frequently each range of values appears.

Code Snippet:

plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
sns.histplot(df['age'], bins=10, kde=False, color='skyblue')
plt.title('Distribution of Age')
plt.xlabel('Age')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.show()


Key Learnings

Data Visualization: Learned the importance of using the right visualization technique for different types of data.

Python Libraries: Gained experience with pandas, seaborn, and matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization.

Variable Types: Improved understanding of categorical vs. continuous variables and when to use bar charts vs. histograms.


Tools Used

Python: Programming language for data analysis and visualization.

Pandas: Library for data manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries for creating visualizations.


Future Improvements

Experiment with additional visualizations, such as box plots or density plots, to gain further insights.

Automate parts of the process to make it easier to visualize different variables in the dataset.
